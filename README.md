# Flipping-flight-widget-JS

 ROTATING flight widget with JavaScript
 
 Flight widget written with JS, html and css.
 
 Several functions, a little of OOP, setInterval method and flipping to make it looks liek a real old school widget.
 
Works fine. Created with help of 'code with aniakubow'. Written twice. Most of it on my own after watching tutorial and
uderstanding how it should work.

Things im happy with:
 1. Few functions which are pretty simple but do their job.
 2. Set interval method gives a life to the app.
 3. Some, not common (for me at least) CSS styles included. Fliping animation, import urls..
 
Thing i need to work with:
 1. Maybe it would be great to store object/s in a different file. Is it necesary in this case? Not sure.
 2. Arrays, i think i need more practice with it.
 3. Time display is not done as i expected to. After reaching 24h it doesnt generate random time, just keep displaying it at 24.(stuff to work with)

In general, app works fine. Widget works and displays data as it should.
But shuffeling data could be coded better. 
Would be nice to get some feedback.
